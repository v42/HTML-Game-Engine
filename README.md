HTML GAME ENGINE
================

This is a concept for an engine in HTML using canvas, inspired on Jason Gregory's Engine Architecture, and this is my graduation project (2011).

This is entirely made in CoffeeScript, and uses game loop concepts without requestAnimationFrame, which I didn't know in that time.

This is no longer mantained, but feel free to clone, read about and ask me anything you need. I am no longer updating it since the idea here is to keep it as it was on the project's delivery date. I might ocasionally update a thing or two just to make it clearer for the people who tries to understand it. Anyway, feel free to ping me at my Twitter (`@Vitor42) if you feel like you miss something.

## How to use it

- Clone this repo && `npm install`
- run `coffee app.coffee`
- http://localhost:4242

## Game Variations

- http://localhost:4242/game2
- http://localhost:4242/game3
- http://localhost:4242/game4

## Recomendations

- Use Firefox! It uses `mozImageSmoothingEnabled = false`, so pixels aren't smoothed!
