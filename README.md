HTML GAME ENGINE
================

This is a concept for an engine in HTML using canvas, inspired on Jason Gregory's Engine Architecture, used as my graduation's project.

This is entirely made in CoffeeScript, and uses game loop concepts without requestAnimationFrame, which I didn't know in that time.

This is no longer mantained, but feel free to clone, read about and ask me anything you need. I am no longer updating it since the idea here is to keep it as it was on the project's delivery date.
